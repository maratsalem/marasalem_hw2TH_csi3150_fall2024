          My current favorite book that I'm reading is called
          <strong>The Shadow of What Was Lost</strong> by James Islington. The
          book is about a young boy named Davian with magical powers, except his
          magic presents in a different form than his peers. To survive, he has
          to pass a test proving he has the ability to control his magical
          powers. However, when Davian discovers the truth of his unique magical
          ability ...plot things happen. Read some reviews of the book here on
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878967">Goodreads</a>,
